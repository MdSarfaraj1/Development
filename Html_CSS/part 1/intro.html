<h1>iron man</h1>
<p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
     by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed
      by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and
      Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 
      in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
       Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a
        superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, 
        and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers,
         have been published consistently since the character's creation.
